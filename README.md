# Prusa Enclosure Addons

As a new owner of Prusa Mini, I built an enclosure following the [official prusa guide](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/cheap-simple-3d-printer-enclosure/).
Besides few deviations from the guide, I also wanted to build temperature monitoring, based on esp32.

This repository contains source code for monitoring the inside/outside temperature (using sht3x temperature sensors) and displaying the data on Nokia 5110 lcd screen.
And the STL files for the temperature module and few other improvements for the enclosure.
